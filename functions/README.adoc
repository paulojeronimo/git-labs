WARNING: This repo is a mirror of {uri-paulojeronimo-git-labs}.
So, it is not maintained directly here, in GitLab.
All changes to this repo occur firstly in GitHub.
Why we have this mirror in GitLab?
Well, GitHub does not render Asciidoc documents correctly as Gitlab does.
You can note, for example, that the clause `includes` in Asciidoc does not work in GitHub.
