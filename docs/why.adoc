The root reason for existence for this project is
*to help programmers to improve their skills in
three (3) main areas*:

. <<create-shell-scripts-with-bash>>.
. <<use-command-line-tools>>.
. <<write-better-documentation>>.

This project consolidates all of these skills by creating a
*final goal: produce labs that demonstrate
{Git}, {GitHub}, or {GitLab} features or solutions*.
