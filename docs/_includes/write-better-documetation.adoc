= Write better documentation

This project will help you to document things better!

We think that *documents and source code needs to be improved at the same time*.
So, we use {uri-what-is-asciidoc}[the asciidoc format^] to evolve our documents!

We write documents even before we developed our code.
And when we develop the code,
we either evolve our documents at the same time
or we do it right afterward to keep them from lagging.

In fact, we use documents to guide us in producing a code
or we use code to generate documents.
We do not believe that code and document should be treated differently.
