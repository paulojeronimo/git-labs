. Name your lab as "lab<3 digits in <<utilities#base58,Base58>>".sh.
.. The first digit will identify you (the contributor).
.. Increment the last two digits as you add more labs.
. Inside your script, describe the purpose of it by writing its second line using the {uri-what-is-asciidoc}[AsciiDoc syntax^].
.. This line should have the format "Purpose: <description>" as in the following example (extracted from link:{basedir}/lab111.sh[]).
Please, write a description in a resumed way.

. Commit the `lab???.sh` script inside your fork.
. Generate the link:{basedir}/README.adoc[] file by typing: `./build.sh --html`.
.. If you have {uri-asciidoctor}[asciidoctor^] installed, this argument `--html` will also generate a `index.html` file.
In this case, you can also use the argument `--serve` to start a `ruby` httpd locally and access http://localhost:8000 to see its content:
+
----
$ ./build.sh --html --serve
----
NOTE: The ruby `httpd` server will be running in background. +
To terminate it, type: `kill $(cat httpd.pid)`.
