We try to use {uri-tdd}[Test Driven Developing (TDD)^] to produce our code.

One of the best ways to do this in this project is through <<utilities#clitest,clitest>>.

With one simple command line you can execute all currently developed:

  $ ./test/all.sh

The command above will produce the following output:

----
include::{basedir}/tmp/test-all.txt[]
